# EIGHTATENFIVE
Project testing under development: OS App using Swift that allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with six different sound modulations. Uses code from Apple's AVFoundation API to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine). The current application is still under development, if you encounter any problems, please contact me.
